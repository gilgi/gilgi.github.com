[10:17:43 PM] Nathan Davis: how many tritzbux do I win?
[10:17:56 PM] Michael Tritz: you can win up to $2000 tritzbux for your performance on AP tests
[10:18:10 PM] Nathan Davis: ok so how else can one acquire tritzbux??
[10:18:24 PM] Michael Tritz: glad you asked
[10:18:37 PM] Michael Tritz: we offer currency changes from US dollars and also B
[10:18:47 PM] Nathan Davis: what is the exchange rate?
[10:18:51 PM] Michael Tritz: a single B is 1000TB
[10:19:09 PM] Michael Tritz: otherwise it is $1 -> 100TB
[10:19:17 PM] Nathan Davis: So if I buy you B 4 times you will write and proctor a test?
[10:19:21 PM] Michael Tritz: for you
[10:19:22 PM] Michael Tritz: yes
[10:19:34 PM] Michael Tritz: there are other rewards in the tritzbux system
[10:20:08 PM] Nathan Davis: name em
[10:20:20 PM] Michael Tritz: for 6000TB i will get you soft serve at the Scott Hall/Scott Conference Center-hosted LAN of your choice
[10:20:26 PM] Michael Tritz: thats unlimited soft serve
[10:20:54 PM] Nathan Davis: 6000tb
[10:20:58 PM] Nathan Davis: equivalent of 6 b's
[10:21:03 PM] Nathan Davis: equivalent to about 30 dollars
[10:21:07 PM] Nathan Davis: minimum
[10:21:07 PM] Michael Tritz: and for 10000TB i will buy you a 12 pack of soda
[10:21:23 PM] Michael Tritz: there is also the hovercraft
[10:21:27 PM] Nathan Davis: 30 dollars=about 10 large imlkshakes from restaurants
[10:21:35 PM] Nathan Davis: hovercraft.
[10:21:38 PM] Michael Tritz: yes
[10:21:49 PM] Michael Tritz: what kind of rewards system would this be without a hovercraft at the top end
[10:22:15 PM] Michael Tritz: for 100000TB i will get you a hovercraft
[10:22:46 PM] Nathan Davis: so 100 b's?
[10:22:57 PM] Michael Tritz: or 98 b's and a solid performance on the AP tests
[10:23:01 PM] Nathan Davis: or about 600 dollars
[10:23:10 PM] Nathan Davis: that seems low for a hovercraft
[10:23:14 PM] Nathan Davis: can you post a link?
[10:23:31 PM] Michael Tritz: no i need to send an email before i can provide you with any details on the hovercraft
[10:23:45 PM] Nathan Davis: when will you send this email?
[10:23:46 PM] Michael Tritz: and i'd really need to see some concrete proof that you're going for the thing
[10:24:05 PM] Michael Tritz: exploratory hovercraft discussions are available at no charge with a minimum balance of 70000TB
[10:25:16 PM] Nathan Davis: I think there is not actually a hovercraft
[10:25:25 PM] Nathan Davis: can I take out a loan of 70000tb?
[10:26:42 PM] Michael Tritz: given your current TB balance i'd really need you to get a good co-signer on a loan like that
[10:26:54 PM] Nathan Davis: who is a good co signer?
[10:27:20 PM] Michael Tritz: someone with a great enough TB balance that i have assurance that i will be paid back the full cost of the loan and interest
[10:27:34 PM] Nathan Davis: who else has any TB
[10:27:53 PM] Michael Tritz: mark and martin for sure have small TB balances
[10:27:55 PM] Michael Tritz: i think sam might?
[10:28:02 PM] Michael Tritz: idk i forget who all has bought me breakfast
[10:28:09 PM] Nathan Davis: I bought you breakfast
[10:28:18 PM] Michael Tritz: you have a small TB balance as well
[10:28:27 PM] Nathan Davis: how many tb do I have
[10:28:35 PM] Michael Tritz: how many times have you bought me breakfast?
[10:28:39 PM] Nathan Davis: 1
[10:28:44 PM] Michael Tritz: you have 1000TB
[10:28:54 PM] Michael Tritz: 1/4 of the way to a test
[10:28:57 PM] Michael Tritz: 1/10 of the way to soda
[10:29:01 PM] Nathan Davis: ok so what if I pool together with 4 other people who have bought you breakfast
[10:29:01 PM] Michael Tritz: 1/100 of the way to hovercraft
[10:29:12 PM] Nathan Davis: and then make you write and proctor a test to yourself
[10:29:21 PM] Michael Tritz: that wouldn't be a very fair test
[10:29:23 PM] Michael Tritz: but ok
[10:29:26 PM] Nathan Davis: on the topic of the hovercraft
[10:29:50 PM] Michael Tritz: whoa whoa whoa
[10:30:03 PM] Michael Tritz: if you want a specific topic for the proctored test i'm afraid thats going to cost extra
[10:30:11 PM] Nathan Davis: more specifically the technical specs of the hovercraft
[10:30:49 PM] Michael Tritz: a proctored test over a particular subject would run you 8000TB
[10:31:20 PM] Nathan Davis: ok
[10:31:25 PM] Nathan Davis: so with my 8000 TB
[10:31:32 PM] Nathan Davis: I mean 1000TB
[10:31:50 PM] Nathan Davis: that should be enough collateral to take out an 8000TB loan
[10:32:29 PM] Michael Tritz: unfortunately i need collateral to the tune of 60% of the loan
[10:32:52 PM] Michael Tritz: so you would need at least 4800TB
[10:33:01 PM] Nathan Davis: so basically 5000 TB
[10:33:16 PM] Michael Tritz: TB can come in more refined increments than thousands
[10:33:29 PM] Michael Tritz: holiday bonuses come out on christmas and the summer solstice
[10:33:40 PM] Nathan Davis: How much is a holiday bonus?
[10:34:22 PM] Michael Tritz: it depends on how successful the growth has been in the Bank of Tritz this year but typically it should be between 5 and 10% of your current balance
[10:35:09 PM] Nathan Davis: is there anything I can buy with tritzbux in a lower increment than 4000?
[10:35:32 PM] Michael Tritz: for 2000TB i will give you a hearty handshake on an occasion of your choice
[10:35:46 PM] Nathan Davis: anything lower than that?
[10:36:01 PM] Michael Tritz: for 500TB i will thank you for your contribution to the Bank of Tritz
[10:36:59 PM] Nathan Davis: ok I want to take out a loan with my 1000 TB for 1600 tb
[10:37:16 PM] Michael Tritz: ok
[10:37:22 PM] Michael Tritz: i'll just take your 1000TB as collateral
[10:37:30 PM] Michael Tritz: you now have 1600 provisional TB
[10:37:35 PM] Nathan Davis: I want to take out a loan with my 1600TB for 2500TB
[10:37:51 PM] Michael Tritz: sorry
[10:38:08 PM] Michael Tritz: provisional TB cannot be used as collateral for loans
[10:38:13 PM] Nathan Davis: ok
[10:38:15 PM] Michael Tritz: they are good for basically anything else
[10:38:33 PM] Nathan Davis: I want 3 thank you's for donations to the Bank of Tritz
[10:38:44 PM] Michael Tritz: thank you for your contribution to the bank of tritz

[10:38:54 PM] Michael Tritz: thank you for your contribution to the bank of tritz
[10:39:03 PM] Michael Tritz: your remaining balance is 100 provisional TB
[10:39:24 PM] Nathan Davis: Can I take you to tritzcourt?
[10:39:29 PM] Michael Tritz: sure
[10:39:34 PM] Michael Tritz: but i am the judge, jury, and your lawyer
[10:39:37 PM] Michael Tritz: and i charge obscene legal fees
[10:39:41 PM] Nathan Davis: okok
[10:39:50 PM] Nathan Davis: I want a state appointed lawyer
[10:40:04 PM] Michael Tritz: i am the state and i appoint myself

[10:40:35 PM] Nathan Davis: So who is the judge again?

[10:40:54 PM] Michael Tritz: Judge Michael Tritz
[10:41:15 PM] Nathan Davis: ok
[10:41:39 PM] Nathan Davis: I am suing Michael Tritz for 4000 TB
[10:41:44 PM] Michael Tritz: on what grounds
[10:41:46 PM] Nathan Davis: For lying in Skype chat
[10:42:04 PM] Michael Tritz: and how is lying in Skype chat an offense to the tune of 4000 TB?
[10:42:11 PM] Michael Tritz: there's no law against it
[10:42:14 PM] Michael Tritz: i throw out the case
[10:42:20 PM] Nathan Davis: I appeal
[10:42:22 PM] Michael Tritz: ok
[10:42:27 PM] Michael Tritz: i reopen the case
[10:42:31 PM] Nathan Davis: ok great
[10:42:47 PM] Nathan Davis: [10:15 PM] Michael Tritz: 

<<< my new name is Michael Siemens
[10:42:54 PM] Nathan Davis: [9:40:40 PM] Nathan Davis: So who is the judge again?
[9:40:42 PM] Michael Tritz: me
[9:40:50 PM] Nathan Davis: who exactly though
[9:40:59 PM] Michael Tritz: Judge Michael Tritz
[10:43:03 PM] Michael Tritz: again i ask
[10:43:07 PM] Nathan Davis: [10:39 PM] Michael Tritz: 

<<< but i am the judge, jury, and your lawyer
[10:43:15 PM] Nathan Davis: hold on
[10:43:16 PM] Michael Tritz: how is lying in Skype chat an offense to the tune of 4000TB?
[10:43:24 PM] Nathan Davis: I need to talk to my lawyer before I make any further moves
[10:43:25 PM] Michael Tritz: as your lawyer, i respond "i don't really know"
[10:44:04 PM] Michael Tritz: sorry but as your lawyer i'm pretty upset that you circumvented the legal fees to get me in court
[10:44:07 PM] Michael Tritz: i have to make a living too
[10:44:11 PM] Michael Tritz: how will i afford my hovercraft?
[10:44:26 PM] Nathan Davis: [10:36 PM] Michael Tritz: 

<<< for 500TB i will thank you for your contribution to the Bank of Tritz
[10:44:27 PM] Paul Quint: This can move to a private chat between you two?
[10:44:38 PM] Nathan Davis: [10:38 PM] Michael Tritz: 

<<< thank you for your contribution to the bank of tritz
[10:44:40 PM] Paul Quint: I'm enjoying it, but 80 messages is ridiculous between 2 people
[10:44:40 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: this is hilarious and is extremely relevent to the sc general chat
[10:44:44 PM] Nathan Davis: clearly not capitalized
[10:45:13 PM] Nathan Davis: obvious failure to meet standards touted by Michael "sleazebag" "Siemens" Tritz
[10:45:50 PM] Nathan Davis: I am opening a separate suit for the 1500 tritzbux I spent to get those poorly delivered thank you's
[10:45:55 PM] Michael Tritz: sorry but as the judge i'm going to have to throw this one out again with no option for appeal
[10:46:03 PM] Nathan Davis: as well as an additional 2500 in damages
[10:46:09 PM] Nathan Davis: for psychological damages
[10:46:19 PM] Nathan Davis: ok I appeal the decision to make this case unappealable
[10:46:30 PM] Michael Tritz: as the Bank of Tritz i am offering to settle out of court by returning the full collateral of your loan to you and allowing you to keep the 100 provisional TB as full TB
[10:46:39 PM] Nathan Davis: deal.
[10:46:50 PM] Nathan Davis: The system works.
[10:47:01 PM] Michael Tritz: your account balance is now 1100TB
[10:58:12 PM] Martin: This is golden. Someone on a computer copy all of this and email it to me please
[10:58:29 PM] Nathan Davis: Martin
[10:58:35 PM] Nathan Davis: Can I have your Tritzbux?
[10:58:46 PM] Martin: Dipends
[10:58:47 PM] Michael Tritz: TB are only semi-transferable
[10:58:48 PM] Michael Tritz: sorry
[10:58:57 PM] Michael Tritz: you can only transfer them to me
[10:59:05 PM] Martin: We do under the table deal
[10:59:15 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: Tritz
[10:59:18 PM] Nathan Davis: Ok
[10:59:20 PM] Nathan Davis: Martin
[10:59:26 PM] Michael Tritz: what thomas
[10:59:31 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: i have a business proposition
[10:59:38 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: for the bank of tritz
[10:59:42 PM] Nathan Davis: Ask tritz to take out a 1600 TB loan to me with your Tritzbux as collateral
[10:59:46 PM] Martin: *oh look, i seem to have dropped my tritzbux in the skype chat*
[11:00:04 PM] Nathan Davis: You arent transferring money to me, he is
[11:00:48 PM] Martin: Thomas. Can you copy all of this and email me a copy?
[11:00:54 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: yeah
[11:00:55 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: im on it
[11:00:57 PM] Martin: Ty
[11:01:11 PM] Michael Tritz: i want to hear proposition
[11:01:54 PM] Martin: I rob the bank of tritz and proceed to steal all the tritzbux and place them in duffel bags for later use
[11:02:08 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: here's the pitch tritz: i build you a useless web app for the bank of tritz allowing self-service loans and whatever other kinds of services you would like to offer, as well as easy manual transaction management
[11:02:22 PM] Martin: Lel
[11:02:33 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: in return you will give me some amount of tritzbux
[11:02:38 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: to be negotiated
[11:02:51 PM] Michael Tritz: how about this
[11:02:57 PM] Michael Tritz: you build me the web app
[11:03:08 PM] Nathan Davis: http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=qh4zX-gQz-Y&feature=endscreen
[11:03:15 PM] Michael Tritz: and in exchange the bank of tritz will put up a prize of 10000TB as the prize for the fistful of canoes tournament
[11:03:27 PM] Martin: Bank has no money
[11:03:33 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: fistful of canoes in jeopardy
[11:03:34 PM] Martin: I took it all remember?
[11:03:36 PM] Nathan Davis: bank can print money
[11:03:40 PM] Michael Tritz: all TB transactions are electronic
[11:03:43 PM] Michael Tritz: you can't steal the internet
[11:03:52 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: no guarantee that it will ever happen
[11:04:09 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: prizes already so great that 10000TB is an insignificant addition to the pool
[11:04:14 PM] Martin: I hook up to your internal servers and transfer 1000000000 tb to myself
[11:04:25 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: not likely to increase viability of fistful
[11:04:29 PM] Michael Tritz: should the tournament fall through i will give you the 10000TB directly subject to you not fixing it so the tournament falls through
[11:04:49 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: define "fall through"
[11:04:56 PM] Michael Tritz: if it does not happen
[11:05:01 PM] Michael Tritz: conditions of which can be determined later
[11:05:05 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: by when?
[11:05:11 PM] Michael Tritz: these are just preliminary discussions
[11:05:21 PM] Michael Tritz: is this a deal you'd be interested in? we can talk more detailed terms if so
[11:05:44 PM] Martin: Tritz
[11:05:51 PM] Martin: Id like to use my tritzbux
[11:05:57 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: i may be interested, i feel like the definition of "fall through" is a little ambiguous though
[11:06:01 PM] Michael Tritz: martin your balance is currently 1000TB
[11:06:19 PM] Martin: What about that recent deposit of 1000000000?
[11:06:24 PM] Martin: I just made it
[11:06:29 PM] Martin: Like 3 minutes ago
[11:06:31 PM] Martin: Check again
[11:06:33 PM] Michael Tritz: oh, that
[11:06:41 PM] Michael Tritz: we made sure to deposit that directly into the coffers of the Bank of Tritz
[11:06:52 PM] Michael Tritz: thank you for your generous donation
[11:06:58 PM] Nathan Davis: HEY
[11:07:03 PM] Nathan Davis: HE DIDNT PAY FOR THAT
[11:07:04 PM] Martin: I'm suing

[11:07:14 PM] Martin: SUE
[11:07:16 PM] Nathan Davis: SUE
[11:07:18 PM] Michael Tritz: "donations" and "contributions" are classified differently by the Bank of Tritz
[11:07:22 PM] Nathan Davis: oh ok
[11:07:35 PM] Martin: I'm suing. You stole my money
[11:07:56 PM] Martin: You want to settle this out of court? Or be publicly humiliated by me?
[11:07:56 PM] Michael Tritz: you do not want to go to court with the Bank of Tritz
[11:08:13 PM] Michael Tritz: the Bank of Tritz is interested only in protecting its assets
[11:08:27 PM] Martin: You stole my money
[11:08:27 PM] Michael Tritz: anyways thomas
[11:08:47 PM] Michael Tritz: i would say that the tournament would need to begin within a month
[11:08:49 PM] Martin: I transferred it to my account, and you took it
[11:09:06 PM] Michael Tritz: but the tournament would have to begin given a certain number of sign-ups
[11:09:09 PM] Martin: I WILL NOT STOP UNTIL JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED!!!
[11:09:30 PM] Nathan Davis: what about the legal fees martin?
[11:09:46 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: lets say, 8 signups total
[11:09:57 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: for a full quarterfinal
[11:11:00 PM] Michael Tritz: 8 signups seems fair
[11:11:15 PM] Martin: I file a law suit against the bank of tritz
[11:11:26 PM] Michael Tritz: who's your lawyer, martin?
[11:11:28 PM | Edited 11:11:40 PM] Martin: I choose to represent myself
[11:11:37 PM] Michael Tritz: aha, good choice
[11:12:04 PM] Martin: You want to settle this out of court? Or be publicly humiliated by me?
[11:12:19 PM] Thomas Gilgenast: pm me to discuss the particular features you would need to see in this webapp in order to deem my end of the contract satisfied
[11:12:25 PM] Michael Tritz: ok lets settle this out of court martin
[11:12:32 PM] Michael Tritz: i offer you absolutely nothing
[11:12:33 PM] Martin: Great
[11:12:36 PM] Martin: Lol
[11:12:37 PM] Paul Quint: wat
[11:12:48 PM] Michael Tritz: you can choose to take the nothing
[11:13:03 PM] Martin: I demand all my money back plus 50000 tb in damages and legal fees
[11:13:07 PM] Michael Tritz: or try going to court against the Bank of Tritz with Judge Tritz on the podium
[11:13:21 PM] Martin: Nothing less
[11:13:23 PM] Michael Tritz: i'm afraid the settlement is non-negotiable
[11:13:36 PM] Michael Tritz: this is our offer
[11:13:38 PM] Martin: You came to me wanting to settle
[11:13:38 PM] Michael Tritz: take it or leave it
[11:13:56 PM] Martin: You don't get to make demands
[11:14:05 PM] Michael Tritz: i'm not making demands
[11:14:12 PM] Martin: Yea you are
[11:14:18 PM] Michael Tritz: i'm offering you a reasonable settlement and informing you that i will not accept any compromises
[11:14:26 PM] Michael Tritz: if you do not take our offer the Bank of Tritz will take you to court
[11:14:31 PM] Martin: But its mot your place to do so
[11:14:35 PM] Martin: I make the offer
[11:14:44 PM] Michael Tritz: you made an offer and i made a counter-offer
[11:14:46 PM] Michael Tritz: there's no issue there
[11:14:50 PM] Martin: Ok
[11:14:54 PM] Martin: My answer:
[11:15:01 PM] Martin: Go to hell. I'll see you in court
[11:15:06 PM] Michael Tritz: sounds good

[11:15:26 PM] Michael Tritz: now
[11:15:36 PM] Paul Quint: DotA
[11:15:38 PM] Martin: I didn't get time to prepare my slanderous points
[11:16:09 PM] Sam Sehi: okay dota
[11:16:15 PM] Michael Tritz: your failure to prepare is not the concern of the court system
[11:16:26 PM] Martin: By law i am required to have at least 30 days to prepare
[11:16:54 PM] Michael Tritz: by whose law? i am the state and i see no problems here
[11:17:14 PM] Martin: Anyways
[11:17:21 PM] Martin: I will play your little game
[11:17:40 PM] Martin: I appeal for a new judge based on a blatant conflict of interests
[11:19:17 PM] Michael Tritz: there are no other judges unfortunately
[11:19:19 PM] Sam Sehi: i would like to submit my application as a supreme tritzcourt judge
[11:19:22 PM] Michael Tritz: nobody else has passed the bar exam yet
[11:19:29 PM] Michael Tritz: you will have to pass the bar exam
[11:19:34 PM] Sam Sehi: you don't need to pass the bar to be a judge
[11:19:41 PM] Martin: ^
[11:19:42 PM] Michael Tritz: you do in the state of tritz
[11:19:52 PM] Nathan Davis: judges are generally chosen from a pool of eligible lawyers
[11:19:52 PM] Martin: Where is that located?
[11:20:19 PM] Martin: I doubt that tritz passed the bar
[11:20:24 PM] Sam Sehi: i find the state of tritz to be in violation of the Geneva Convention, where Geneva said that people don't need to pass the bar to be judges
[11:20:38 PM] Michael Tritz: [11:19 PM] Nathan Davis: 

<<< judges are generally chosen from a pool of eligible lawyers
[11:20:45 PM] Michael Tritz: eligible lawyers need to pass the bar
[11:20:46 PM] Sam Sehi: no necessarily
[11:20:55 PM | Edited 11:21:19 PM] Martin: Ok. whatever. Moot point
[11:21:02 PM] Sam Sehi: judges must pass a test in order to be appointed
[11:21:07 PM] Michael Tritz: ok
[11:21:08 PM] Martin: Neither you nor sam have passed the bar
[11:21:08 PM] Sam Sehi: moot point*
[11:21:15 PM] Michael Tritz: it costs 8000TB for a test on a specific subject sam
[11:21:18 PM] Michael Tritz: do you have 8000TB
[11:21:31 PM] Martin: I do
[11:21:37 PM] Sam Sehi: I passed my tests in the state of anarchy
[11:21:42 PM] Martin: Haha
[11:22:01 PM] Martin: I appeal for third party arbitration
[11:22:22 PM] Sam Sehi: do you have a venue for this party, and who is invited?
[11:22:24 PM] Martin: And by that i mean another independent state
[11:23:20 PM] Nathan Davis: I think that the governor of Nevada can help you out here
[11:23:39 PM] Nathan Davis: whoever can give me a single cobblestone can have my ruling
