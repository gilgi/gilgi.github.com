I'm Thomas Gilgenast, a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania. I spend most of my time doing [research](/research), [coding](/coding), taking [pictures of our cat, Lux](/galleries/lux), and ballroom dancing.

I also dabble in [music](https://soundcloud.com/wangilshen-and-sons), photography of [light and shadow](https://edge-of-night-or-riot-blog.tumblr.com), and [webcomics](http://romanchickens.gilgi.org). I've run an [anime fandom tumblr](https://kill-la-kill-or-riot.tumblr.com) and a [novelty Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ti4earthshaker), and I've been known to type out [math notes](/math).
